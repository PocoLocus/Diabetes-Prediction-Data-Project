Overview:
This is a data analysis project on a diabetes prediction dataset. The first part of the Jupyter Notebook (Diabetes prediction.ipynb) covers data cleaning, feature engineering and explanatory data analysis with visualizations and insights. The second part focuses on building and evaluating models using both with Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. Several models where tuned and compared to identify the most effective one for predicting diabetes status.

Addictionally, the project includes a Flask-based web application (Diabetes_flask_app). Patients can input their details (age, gender, BMI, etc.) and the app provides a prediction of their diabetes status using the best-performing model.

Core Features:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries and visualizations to identify trends and correlations.
- Predictive modeling: Multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models trained and tuned for diabetes prediction.
- Flask-based prediction app: Patients can enter personal health data and get diabetes risk prediction using the optimized model.

Tech Stack:
- Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
- Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine learning / Deep learning: scikit-learn / Keras(TensorFlow)
- Web app backend: Flask
- Web app frontend: HTML, Bootstrap
